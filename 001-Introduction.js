Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is mostly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow
client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.Client-side javascript is the most common form of the language. The script
should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be
interpreted by the browser.

You might use js to check whether the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form fied.The JS code is executed when the user submits the form,
and only if all the entries are valid,they would bbe submitted to the web server. Javascript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks,link navigation and
other actions that the user initiates explicity or implicity.

ADVANTAGES OF JS.
Less sever interaction- this is done by validating the user before sending the page off to the server.this saves server traffic.
Immediate feedback to the visitor-They dont have to wait for a page to reload.
increased interactivity.
Richer interfaces-I tems such as drag and drop components and sliders are included using JS to give a rich interface 
to your site visitors.

LIMITATIONS 
client-side js does dont allow the reading and writing of files.this has been kept for security purposes.
JS cannot be used for networking apps because it does not support such.
